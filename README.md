# Notifications Panel

The purpose of this repository panel is the development of mechanisms to shape and exchange notifications. We will explore use cases and requirements pertaining to activities in the Solid ecosystem, identify how existing specifications can be reused; including their specialisations and extensions, as well as develop new specifications. The work will be driven and refined by implementation experience. This panel will collaborate with other Solid panels and so may take on or pass on challenges.
