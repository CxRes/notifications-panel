### Incorporate feedback to Webhook Proposal
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/pull/34


### Use Cases and Requirements
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/pull/32


### Why does notification negotiation happen through an endpoint rather than in a resource-oriented way?
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/14

* SC: Created https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/355 about specifying discovery and description of authoritative information about the server on the Solid Protocol (SP) level. This information can essentially cover "communication options" which would be one of the things we need to visit in the Notifications Protocol (NP) for the Discovery of the Notification Gateway: https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#notification-gateway
* SC: NP should use the solution coming out of 355.
* SC: Current method relies on `.well-known/solid` but that may not be suitable. May be at risk (as mentioned in previous 2021-10-25 meeting) and we should revisit / PR etc.


### Notifications Protocol Tests
* SC: We are covering bits and pieces of tests as we go:
* SC: Any requirements from specs?
* SC: Create `solid/solid-notifications-tests`?
* SC: What should the initial tests covers, e.g., browser based?
* SC: In a past meeting, Pete said: "I expect to work on capability in CTH during Q1 2022 - sounds like it fits for starting to test implementations". Let's continue from there.
