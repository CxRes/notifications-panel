## Topics

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback going forward. Links to servers/applications welcome.


### Discovery of Notification Subscription Metadata
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58

* SC: There is now `solid:storageDescription` in Solid Protocol ED ( https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/416 , https://solidproject.org/ED/protocol#server-storage-description )



### Solid Notifications Protocol: Review notes
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/76


### Next release of Notifications Protocol
* SC: Solid Protocol 0.9.1 will be released with https://github.com/specification/issue/355 resolved and will require (`MUST`) Notifications Protocol (NP). So, we should resolve https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58 (along with some other low hanging fruit and other dependencies), and publish NP-next prior to Solid Protocol 0.9.1.


### Subscription Response
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/72

* SC: Follows action of https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-19.md#protocol-doesnt-mention-subscription-response re https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/57 .
* SC: Updated PR.


### Add definitions for notification channel discovery and capabilities
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/70

* SC: There was plenty of time to review. Any objections to merge?


### Interchangeable use of notification channel type and subscription type
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/71

* SC: I think we can/should review the modeling around this.
* SC: I think this is a bug. Lets come back to it with responses...
