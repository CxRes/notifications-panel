## Topics

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback going forward. Links to servers/applications welcome.


### Discovery of Notification Subscription Metadata
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58

* SC: We need to resolve some outstanding questions.


### Solid Notifications Protocol: Review notes
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/76

* SC: Talked with Tim about it (some specifics) but I didn't process the notes/review yet.


### Subscription Request Response
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/72

* SC: Followed up but (I) still need to wrap up: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/72#discussion_r913913397 . My author-level preference is to keep request/response to JSON-LD.


### Interchangeable use of notification channel type and subscription type
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/71

>* SC: I think we can/should review the modeling around this.
>* SC: I think this is a bug. Lets come back to it with responses...


### Next release of Notifications Protocol
* SC: Solid Protocol 0.9.1 will be released with https://github.com/specification/issue/355 resolved and will require (`MUST`) Notifications Protocol (NP). So, we should resolve https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/58 (along with some other low hanging fruit and other dependencies), and publish NP-next prior to Solid Protocol 0.9.1.
