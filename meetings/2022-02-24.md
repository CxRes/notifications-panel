## Topics

### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback going forward. Links to servers/applications welcome.

#### Classic WebSocket with the Updates-Via header
* SC: Using JSON-LD payload (instead of the pub/sub one line) will be compatible with the Notifications Data Model (leaning towards AS2).

#### Issues/challenges for all subscription types
* SC: ...
