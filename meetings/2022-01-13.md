## Topics

### Consideration for Weekly Meetings
* SC: Follows https://gitter.im/solid/notifications-panel?at=61d5725e46529077f56c360a
* SC: How does everyone feel about changing to weekly meetings to compensate for cancellations (and having to postpone to next scheduled meeting)?
* SC: Noting that four people are so far in favour so far.


### Replace separate gateway endpoint with RDF-based protocol discovery
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/29



### Define EventSourceSubscription2021 type for Solid Notifications
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/27

#### Remove EventSource section from Notifications Protocol?



### Define WebSocketSubscription2021 type for Solid Notifications
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/28

#### Remove WebSocket section from Notifications Protocol?



### Subscription Type Registries
* SC: At some point Notifications Protocol will not be updated regularly, however, (new) subscription types should be discoverable.
* SC: Have Notifications protocol link to a SubscriptionType Registries where it list and links to current subscription types, and then update the registry document when new types are made available? Similar to did-core and did-spec-registries... or is there a simpler/better solution? Perhaps unnecessary?
* SC: AFAICT, the registries will not require a different process than our current process for advancing specs.



### Subscription Types Extension
URL: https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#subscription-types-extension

* SC: Subscription type extension is intended to outline the core requirements for existing or new subscription types.



### Remove Use Cases from Notifications Protocol
* SC: Briefly mention UCs in Introduction
* SC: Refer to UCR



### Add Solid Notification JSON-LD context
URL: https://github.com/solid/vocab/pull/62

* SC: Follows https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2021-12-16.md#add-solid-notification-json-ld-context
* SC: AC created the JSON-LD context. Please review.
* SC: I can follow up with TimBL and/or Editors to review + merge.



### Solid Notifications Vocabulary
* SC: Follows https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2021-12-16.md#add-solid-notification-json-ld-context
* SC: We'll need to follow-up on creating the vocab: http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification



### Solid Notifications Protocol ~FPWD
* SC: Follows https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2021-12-16.md#solid-notifications-protocol-fpwd

#### Notifications Protocol Publication Date
* SC: We shouldn't wait on major work to create a ~FPWD. Keeping that in mind:
* SC: Pending no outstanding PRs blocking ~FPWD, agree to publish 2022-01-20 or 2022-01-27.. ?
* SC: We can clean-up minor work as mentioned above, if Registries was approved above, should that be required before publication?
* SC: Wait to merge JSON-LD context and Vocabulary before publishing?


#### Notifications Protocol Draft URL
* SC: It should makes its way to `https://solidproject.org/TR/{shortname}` (via solid/specification repository). Not short but readable/guessable (also not that out of the ordinary eg. `activitystreams-core or -vocabulary`): `https://solidproject.org/TR/notifications-protocol`. Other suggestions?
* SC: Related: URLs of Subscription Types may need to be available in the same way. Solid Protocol will refer to both Solid Notifications Protocol and WebSocketSubscription2021 (or possibly "latest published version"?)
