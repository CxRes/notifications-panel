### Use Cases and Requirements
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/pull/32

* SC: "Deliver UCR by 2021-10-28" is marked as a "~FPWD" milestone on GitHub as per https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2021-09-16.md .
* SC: That's today. An internal (panel) deadline. Per Charter, the UCR draft can be 2021-Q4.
* The PR'd UCR is not equivalent to FWPD. In the 2021-10-14, I've asked if anyone would like to work on it but no one volunteered, so we had to postpone assignment.
* SC: I've created the initial UCR document in any case. We need to move this forward. Unless there are objections, I'd like to continue author/edit this document. We need additional coauthors/editors. I'm happy to step down as well as long as there is some ownership.

#### Request reviews from Solid Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Team (DEIT)
* SC: PRE-PROPOSAL. DEIT https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/DEI%20Team , https://gitter.im/solid/DEIT , https://github.com/solid/deit ) to review each Use Case.
* SC: Acknowledged/approved by DEIT https://github.com/solid/deit/blob/main/meetings/2021-11-09.md#deit-to-review-use-cases-in-specification-development .
* Mentioned also at TPAC 2021: https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2021-10-27.md#panel-participation and Editors meeting: https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2021-11-10.md#deit-to-review-use-cases-in-specification-development

### Notifications Protocol Tests
* SC: FPWD Secure Web Sockets spec is due by 2021-11-25 (that's an internal date/aim as opposed to charter's 2021-Q4). Are there people interested in making use of a test suite? When?
* SC: Any requirements from specs?
* SC: Who will work on on the tests?
* SC: Create `solid/solid-notifications-tests`?
* SC: What should the initial tests covers, e.g., browser based?
* SC: In the last meeting, Pete said: "I expect to work on capability in CTH during Q1 2022 - sounds like it fits for starting to test implementations". Let's continue from there.


### Incorporate feedback to Webhook Proposal
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/pull/34

* SC: Thanks for following up. Okay with me. Please consider incorporating Ted's suggestions in the PR.
* SC: PRE-PROPOSAL: Move solid-webhooks-notifications to solid/notifications ?
