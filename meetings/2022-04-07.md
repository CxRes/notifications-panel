### Notifications Protocol and WebSocket Subscription Type PRs
* SC: Proposals to add technical reports TR/2022/notifications-protocol-20220401 and TR/2022/websocket-subscription-2021-20220401:
 * https://github.com/solid/specification#391
 * https://github.com/solid/specification#392
* SC: Updates can be done at source in the Editor's Drafts at https://github.com/solid/notifications . The snapshots that need to flow back to https://github.com/solid/specification can be done at:
 * https://github.com/solid/notifications/tree/TR/2022/notifications-protocol-20220401
 * https://github.com/solid/notifications/tree/TR/2022/websocket-subscription-2021-20220401
* SC: Some members of the Editors Team will review next week and afterwards.
* SC: Questions or comments?


* SC: The snapshots use version numbers as previously agreed in this panel. It may change based on Editors Team/process recommendation - TBD next week.
* SC: Questions or comments?


* SC: Bikeshedding alert: Used `notifications-protocol` and `websocket-subscription-2021`  as "shortnames" in the snapshots. Not short-short but not unheard of either e.g., https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/ , https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/ . In [2022-03-31 meeting](https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-03-31.md#publication-of-notifications-protocol-fpwd)'s scratchpad, I was playing with `nopr` as abbreviation for the Notifications Protocol but not sure if that's great. Went ahead with the clear names for now.
* SC: Questions or comments?



### Guidance to Subscription Type Publishers 1
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/59

* SC: Follows action of https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-03-31.md#registries-directory-index-for-subscription-types
* SC: I think it needs minor changes to the language e.g., don't use text that hints at additional process that doesn't exist yet. The regular panel/CG process to receiving and reviewing PRs will do.


### URL of Notifications Protocol Subscription Types
* SC: Notifications Protocol is currently linking to the subscription types list at https://github.com/solid/notifications#subscription-types . It is also available from https://github.com/solid/notifications/blob/main/README.md#subscription-types .
* SC: I think the spec should use a URL under Solid (as a general rule): `https://solidproject.org/TR/{id}` and that document should only include the subscription types that are also published under Solid TR/. It is okay for the notifications panel to continue to list all ED subscription types in the GitHub repository.
* SC: If no objections, this needs to be an ACTION.


### Define Notification Content
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/60

* SC: Please review.
* SC: Notifications Protocol includes a core section for the Data Model. I suggest updating that section instead of a separate work item. If/when the Data Model becomes more prominent/complicated, we can separate.


### Update Delta Feature
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/61

* SC: Please review.
