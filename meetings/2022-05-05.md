>ACTION: [..] create new document that will go to /TR/ (immediately after publishing the WS type), possibly immediately after the current spec PRs are merged

* SC: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/401

>ACTION: [..] to review RG's PR to adjust the text as described above (to move that process forward and to describe the purpose of this README) -- link to these minutes

* SC: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/59#issuecomment-1118559477 , https://github.com/solid/notifications/commit/d19b943fbf2f4fcf66088fac9af1c5f0a5e7ccf6

>ACTION: [..] to create an issue in the GH repository to track this
* SC: https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/66

* SC: Remaining actions:

>ACTION: update the solid notifications protocol to point to the new document

* SC: Let's roll this into the next topic.


### Reconsider Index/Registration of things about the Notifications Protocols
* SC: Can we broaden the purpose of this document to include any indexing of parameters, properties, and values used with the Solid Notifications Protocol?
* SC: Should we just call it a "registry"? And so use /TR/notification-protocol-registries ?


### Notifications Protocol and WebSocket Subscription Type PRs
* SC: https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/391 and https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/392
* SC: One review from the Editor's Team. <del>Another review to follow "soon".</del>
* SC: Will follow up the current review - seems to be minor and non-blocker for this publication. We can wait for other reviews before making any changes.
* SC: I'm okay to take the action to update the ED and the proposed TR. And then merge both PRs.


### Storage Description
* SC: I was hoping that we somehow resolve https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/355 and get that factored into the initial publication - brought that up in the last Editor's Team meeting but we didn't get too far into that. Needs a bit more work. Might not get that done in this week.
* SC: So.. we definitely need to let this go for this release and hope to include/reference it in a future release of the Notifications Protocol release.





### Define WebPushSubscription2022 type for Solid Notifications
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/64

* SC: Please review.


### Protocol doesn't mention Subscription Response
* SC: Follows action of https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-04-28.md#protocol-doesnt-mention-subscription-response re https://github.com/solid/notifications/issues/57 

* SC: I didn't get to doing this.
