## Topics

URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/29

* SC: No objections or outstanding concerns? Merge.
* SC: The primary purpose of this PR seems to be fulfilled. Some follow-ups for consideration:


#### Server accepts GET, HEAD and OPTIONS requests targeting subscription resource.
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/29#issuecomment-1009840586

* SC: Thoughts? Create issue/PR?


### Define EventSourceSubscription2021 type for Solid Notifications
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/27

* SC: No objections or outstanding concerns? Merge.


### Define WebSocketSubscription2021 type for Solid Notifications
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/28

* SC: No objections or outstanding concerns? Merge.


### Define StreamingHTTPSubscription2021 type for Solid Notifications
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/31

* SC: No objections or outstanding concerns? Merge.


### Define LinkedDataNotificationsSubscription2021 type for Solid Notifications
https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/32

* SC: Please review. Overview needs to be written/updated. Terminology section needs to be updated. Same goes for all subscription types.



### Add Solid Notification JSON-LD context
URL: https://github.com/solid/vocab/pull/62

* SC: Follows https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2021-12-16.md#add-solid-notification-json-ld-context
* SC: AC created the JSON-LD context. Please review.
* SC: I can follow up with TimBL and/or Editors to review + merge.
* AC: Vocab not in Turtle format.


### Solid Notifications Vocabulary
* SC: Follows https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2021-12-16.md#add-solid-notification-json-ld-context
* SC: We'll need to follow-up on creating the vocab: http://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification


### Solid Notifications Protocol ~FPWD
* SC: Follows https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2021-12-16.md#solid-notifications-protocol-fpwd

#### Notifications Protocol Publication Date
* SC: We shouldn't wait on major work to create a ~FPWD. Keeping that in mind:
* SC: Presuming no outstanding PRs blocking ~FPWD, agree to publish 2022-01-20 or 2022-01-27...?
* SC: We can clean-up minor work as mentioned above, if Registries was approved above, should that be required before publication?
* SC: Wait to merge JSON-LD context and Vocabulary before publishing?


#### Notifications Protocol Draft URL
* SC: It should makes its way to `https://solidproject.org/TR/{shortname}` (via solid/specification repository). Not short but readable/guessable (also not that out of the ordinary, e.g., `activitystreams-core` or `-vocabulary`): `https://solidproject.org/TR/notifications-protocol`. Other suggestions?
* SC: Related: URLs of Subscription Types may need to be available in the same way. Solid Protocol will refer to both Solid Notifications Protocol and WebSocketSubscription2021 (or possibly "latest published version"?)
