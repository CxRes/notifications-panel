* SC: There is an action to update https://solidproject.org/ED/protocol so that it refers to these TRs but the level of requirement is still under discussion by the Editors of that spec ( https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/2022-05-18.md#change-reference-to-solid-notifications-protocol ). Will keep you posted.
