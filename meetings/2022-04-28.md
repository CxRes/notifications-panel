## Topics


### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback going forward. Links to servers/applications welcome.


### Notifications Protocol and WebSocket Subscription Type PRs
* SC: One review from the Editor's Team. Another review to follow "soon".
* SC: Will follow up the current review - seems to be minor and non-blocker for this publication. We can wait for other reviews before making any changes.
* SC: Will look into resolving / merging 2022-05-04. I'll ping the Editor's Team about it in any case.
* SC: I was hoping that we somehow resolve https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/355 and get that factored into the initial publication - brought that up in the last Editor's Team meeting but we didn't get too far into that.
* SC: We may need to change the version. Will resolve as part of 2022-05-04 merging (IMO).


### Guidance to Subscription Type Publishers 1
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/59

* SC: Minor follow-up. Not urgent. Time to integrate this in while reviews from the Editors team is taking place. Can we wrap this up this week so that we can include it part of Notifications Protocol that's currently under review ( https://github.com/solid/specification/pull/391 )?
* SC: Made a brief comment to move this forward; otherwise we can merge the suggestions. The text between README and spec does not need to be different.


### URL of Notifications Protocol Subscription Types
* SC: Follow-up on https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-04-07.md#url-of-notifications-protocol-subscription-types and https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-04-14.md#url-of-notifications-protocol-subscription-types
>ACTION: AC to review RG's PR to adjust the text as described above (to move that process forward and to describe the purpose of this README) -- link to these minutes
>ACTION: AC to create new document that will go to /TR/ (immediately after publishing the WS type), possibly immediately after the current spec PRs are merged
>ACTION: update the solid notifications protocol to point to the new document
>ACTION: AC to create an issue in the GH repository to track this

>* SC: Again, we have time re Editors reviews in parallel.
>* AC: I have not completed the items assigned to me yet but will this week.
>* SC: We should set as a goal that the publication of the ~FPWD to add description of the subscription types and where they can be found
>* SC: Something like `/TR/notification-subscription-types`.
>* AC: I assume this would be part of an independent PR to `solid/specification`
>* SC: Yes, that makes sense
>* SC: In the W3C process, editors are able/expected to make editorial changes where appropriate

* SC: Can we resolve these actions before 2022-05-04?
