## Topics


### WIP Implementation Feedback
* SC: We'll allocate some time for implementation feedback going forward. Links to servers/applications welcome.
* SC: nothing yet, but planning to implement protocol and websocket subscription

### Notifications Protocol and WebSocket Subscription Type PRs
* SC: No reviews in solid/specification from Editors Team but expecting at least two.
* SC: Editors' meeting discussed this and plan to review
* AC: Is there a timeframe for this?
* SC: The timeframe is not fixed. It's "ASAP" but without a strict deadline. Generally, that means "this week"
* AC: Having a clear expectation about a timeframe for reviews would be very helpful

### Guidance to Subscription Type Publishers 1
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications/pull/59

* SC: Minor follow-up. Not urgent. Time to integrate this in while reviews from the Editors team is taking place. We can probably wrap this PR up by next week?
* SC: Made a brief comment to move this forward; otherwise we can merge the suggestions. The text between README and spec does not need to be different. 

### URL of Notifications Protocol Subscription Types
* SC: Follow-up on https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2022-04-07.md#url-of-notifications-protocol-subscription-types
>ACTION: AC to review RG's PR to adjust the text as described above (to move that process forward and to describe the purpose of this README) -- link to these minutes
>ACTION: AC to create new document that will go to /TR/ (immediately after publishing the WS type), possibly immediately after the current spec PRs are merged
>ACTION: update the solid notifications protocol to point to the new document
>ACTION: AC to create an issue in the GH repository to track this

* SC: Again, we have time re Editors reviews in parallel.
* AC: I have not completed the items assigned to me yet but will this week.
* SC: We should set as a goal that the publication of the ~FPWD to add description of the subscription types and where they can be found
* SC: Something like `/TR/notification-subscription-types`.
* AC: I assume this would be part of an independent PR to `solid/specification`
* SC: Yes, that makes sense
* SC: In the W3C process, editors are able/expected to make editorial changes where appropriate
