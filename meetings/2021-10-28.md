### Notifications Protocol

#### Notifications Protocol Repository
* SC: One of the ACTION from https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2021-10-14.md#notifications-protocol-repository was to create `solid/solid-notifications` however that's alrady in use. Created `solid/notifications`. If anyone prefers a different name, please say so. Otherwise, this action can be marked as completed.
* SC: The other ACTION was to move relevant issues to the new repository. Completed. Also announced on Gitter chat: https://gitter.im/solid/notifications-panel?at=61794e8d29ddcd02934927ae

#### Notifications Protocol
* SC: Created the Notifications Protocol specification in HTML in https://github.com/solid/notifications . It is published and publicly accessible from https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol


### Webhooks Proposal
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/pull/29

* SC: If @jaxoncreed is present, they can have the mic. Feedback from the others can follow.
* SC: I prefer to hold off any decisions until Jackson is here.


### Use Cases and Requirements
URL: https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/pull/32

* SC: "Deliver UCR by 2021-10-28" is marked as a "~FPWD" milestone on GitHub as per https://github.com/solid/notifications-panel/blob/main/meetings/2021-09-16.md .
* SC: That's today. An internal (panel) deadline. Per Charter, the UCR draft can be 2021-Q4.
* The PR'd UCR is not equivalent to FWPD. In the 2021-10-14, I've asked if anyone would like to work on it but no one volunteered, so we had to postpone assignment.
* SC: I've created the initial UCR document in any case. We need to move this forward. Unless there are objections, I'd like to continue author/edit this document. We need additional coauthors/editors. I'm happy to step down as well as long as there is some ownership.
* SC: PRE-PROPOSAL: Request Solid Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Team (DEIT) ( https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/DEI%20Team , https://gitter.im/solid/DEIT , https://github.com/solid/deit ) to review each Use Case.

### Notifications Protocol Tests
* SC: FPWD Secure Web Sockets spec is due by 2021-11-25 (that's an internal date/aim as opposed to charter's 2021-Q4). Are there people interested in making use of a test suite? When?
* SC: Who will work on on the tests?
* SC: Create `solid/solid-notifications-tests`?
* SC: What should the initial tests covers, e.g., browser based?
* SC: In the last meeting, Pete said: "I expect to work on capability in CTH during Q1 2022 - sounds like it fits for starting to test implementations".
